# xfce4-terminal3
This is an attempt to port [xfce4-terminal](http://docs.xfce.org/apps/terminal/start) to gtk3/vte3.

The main reason for the porting is this [issue](https://github.com/MidnightCommander/mc/issues/103) which makes
midnight commander unusable with the current version of the terminal.

## Status
Application is bulding but NOT running: 'GTK+ 2.x symbols detected. Using GTK+ 2.x and GTK+ 3 in the same process is not supported'.
