# xfce4-terminal3

This is an attempt to port [xfce4-terminal](http://docs.xfce.org/apps/terminal/start) to gtk3/vte3.

The main reason for the porting is this [issue](https://github.com/MidnightCommander/mc/issues/103) which makes
midnight commander unusable with the current version of the terminal.
