# xfce4-terminal3
This is a port of [xfce4-terminal](http://docs.xfce.org/apps/terminal/start) to gtk3/vte3.

The main reason for the porting is this [issue](https://github.com/MidnightCommander/mc/issues/103)
which makes midnight commander unusable with the official version of the terminal.

## Status
The application is building, running and free of the issue mentioned above!

Hoewever, there some obvious issues related to the window size (see the Issues section).
